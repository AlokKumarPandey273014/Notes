Question: What is an Escape Character in C#?

An escape character is used to represent special characters inside a string that cannot be written directly.  
In C#, the escape character is the backslash (\).

Common Escape Sequences:

\'   → Single quote
\"   → Double quote
\\   → Backslash
\n   → New line
\t   → Tab space
\b   → Backspace (removes previous character)

Examples:

Console.WriteLine("Hello\nWorld");
// Output:
// Hello
// World

Console.WriteLine("Name:\tAlok");
// Output: Name:    Alok

Console.WriteLine("It\'s okay");
// Output: It's okay

Console.WriteLine("\"Good\"");
// Output: "Good"
